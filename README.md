# 🌟 The Tale of Happy & Angry Face Tic-Tac-Toe 🎁😁😡

Once upon a time, in a kingdom filled with 🎁 treasure boxes, two mighty spirits roamed the land.

* One was **Happy Face 😁**, who spread joy, laughter, and smiles wherever it went.
* The other was **Angry Face 😡**, who carried storms, fire, and thunder in its heart.

The King of the Land grew tired of their endless quarrels and devised a magical board of **nine enchanted gift boxes 🎁**. He declared:

> *“Whoever can line up three of their faces in a row shall be crowned the winner of this eternal game!”*

And thus, the legendary **Happy & Angry Face Tic-Tac-Toe** was born.

## ✨ How the Game Works

1. Two brave adventurers step forward: **Player 1 (X)** and **Player 2 (Y)**.
2. The board begins full of mysterious 🎁 gift boxes, hiding empty spaces.
3. When Player 1 chooses **X**, the **Happy Spirit 😁** appears randomly on the board.
4. When Player 2 chooses **Y**, the **Angry Spirit 😡** storms onto the board in a random spot.
5. The game continues until one spirit forms a magical **line of three**:

   * Across the top, middle, or bottom,
   * Or down the left, center, or right,
   * Or even diagonally, weaving magic from corner to corner.

Every victory earns **3 points**, as the kingdom cheers: 🎉

## 🏆 How to Win

* Three 😁 in a row → **Happy Face wins!** 🌞
* Three 😡 in a row → **Angry Face wins!** 🌩️

The board resets after each victory, so the saga continues until the adventurers grow weary.

## 🎮 Controls

* Player 1 enters **X** to summon 😁.
* Player 2 enters **Y** to summon 😡.
* Enter **Q** at any time if you wish to quit the tale (but the kingdom will be sad 👋).

## 🌍 Moral of the Story

Sometimes in life, choices are random — you don’t always pick where you’ll land. But whether you smile 😁 or rage 😡, the game goes on, and the treasure boxes 🎁 will always open again for a new story.
